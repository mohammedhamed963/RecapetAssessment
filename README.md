**Note:** We did assertions as separate test nodes to show them nicely on HTML report. So even small checks appear as tests in report.  

## How to install dependencies
- Make sure you have Java 11 installed  
- Maven should be installed (or use the Maven wrapper if you want)  
- Run `mvn clean install` to download all dependencies  
- You may need ChromeDriver or geckodriver in PATH for selenium tests  

## How to run tests

```bash
mvn test
